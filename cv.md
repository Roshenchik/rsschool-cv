## About Myself:
I am 21 years old. I am in my last year at Belarusian State Academy of Aviation. My goal is to learn a demanded and creative profession, so my choice fell on web development. Being able to animate a web page and create its functionality makes me feel excited. Moreover, there are a lot of resources for almost unlimited personal growth and self-education in that field. I am ready to work as much as needed to get result. I have good people skills, strong discipline and high stress resistance.

## Code example:
**Detect Pangram**\
*A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).
**Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not.** Ignore numbers and punctuation.*
```
function isPangram(str){
  const upCase = str.toUpperCase()
  const letterOnly = upCase.split('').filter((l) => l >= 'A' && l <= 'Z')
  const setSize = new Set (letterOnly).size
  return setSize >= 26 ? true : false
}
```
